# Congestive Heart Failure Detection in ECGs using Signal Processing Techniques 

## Dicription
The repoitory includes the code created to perform 1-dimensional signal processing on ECG signals to detect congetsive heart failure.
It also includes set of ECGs that can be used to test the code and the output.

## Data Source
The data used was aqcuired from https://archive.physionet.org/.

## How to Use
