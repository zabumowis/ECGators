# Congestive Heart Failure Detection in ECGs using Signal Processing Techniques 

## Discription
The repoitory includes the code created to perform 1-dimensional signal processing on ECG signals to detect congetsive heart failure.
It also includes set of ECGs that can be used to test the code and the output.
Signals that are provided are 10 second long. However, they can be longer if necessary.
Note that all the files were given in .mat format.

## Data Source
The data used was aqcuired from https://archive.physionet.org/. Database: BIDMC Congestive Heart Failure Database.

## How to Use
After donwnloading the file onto the desktop, run matlab.
Next, open the files and make sure that the code and the dataset are in the same folder being used by matlab. 
Finally, run the code and enter the patient ECG reading you would like to test.
